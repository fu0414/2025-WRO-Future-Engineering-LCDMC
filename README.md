## Preface

We are from TWGHs Lee Ching Dea Memorial College.Our participants include Tsoi Ka Fu,Chong Ching Kit and Zhang Yuchao.This is our technical document.
Our team is made up of a group of student who love technology and robots.We hope to think about how robots can solve problems through innovative design,technology and different ideas,and in the upcoming WRO competition WRO competition,we will show our creativity,technology and strive for good results.

Therefore,in the WRO competiton.Our main goal is to show our problems-solving ability and teamwork.We hope to design and develop a robot that can solve practical problems.Therefore,we believe that only by constantly challenging ourselves can we achieve higher goals.Every competition is an opportunity to learn,and we will make full use of these experiences to make continuous progress and pursue excellence.

## Design plan

Regarding this WRO car, we use a custom car. It is rear-wheel-drive (RWD) to ensure its power supply. In addition, this car has a double-layer design. The bottom layer can hold different controllers such as batteries, motors and servos. On the second layer, we put orin nano 8GB to control the speed and direction of the vehicle. With this double-layer design, we put heavier objects on the lower layer, so the center of gravity of this car is low and it is not easy to tilt during operation.
